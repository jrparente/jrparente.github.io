# Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio project created as an assignment for the MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course. The portfolio showcases my skills and projects developed during the course.

## Introduction

This portfolio project serves as a showcase of my journey in mastering the MERN stack. It highlights my skills as a web developer and demonstrates the projects I've built during the course.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The portfolio is designed to ensure optimal viewing experience across various devices, ensuring accessibility and usability for all users.

- **Single Page Application (SPA) Functionality:** Utilizes a simple routing system built with JavaScript to enable seamless navigation between different sections without the need for page reloads. This approach enhances both developer and user experience by reducing loading times and providing a smoother navigation experience.

- **Efficient Header and Footer Management:** By employing SPA functionality, header and footer elements are included in the `index.html` file, and therefore they are consistent across all pages and are only edited once, streamlining development efforts and maintaining a cohesive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Git (version control)
- GitHub Pages (deployment)
